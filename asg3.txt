                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                      So you want to be a soccer coach? This quick and easy crash course
                      will get you on your way to successfully coaching a junior league
                      soccer team in no time!
                      <br><br>
                      This tutorial will teach you the basics of being a junior league
                      soccer coach. From starting your team off with basic formations,
                      learning the basic rules of the game, and explaining the offside rule
                      (and how to use it to your advantage!).

              <article id="formation">
                <h3>Basic Formation</h3>

                      The easiest and most basic formation in soccer is the 4-4-2 formation.
                      It is the most commonly-used formation in the game, and is the ideal
                      formation for any beginner team looking to find a balance in their
                      defense, midfield, and attacking form.
                      <br><br>
                      The formation looks like so:
                      <br>

                      <br><br>
                      While all positions in this formation are crucial, the most important
                      players in any formation are the midfielders. Your midfield serves both
                      as the playmaking zone and the recovery zone. For your midfield, you
                      should select players that are quick, agile, and have good control of the
                      ball. Your midfield moves up and down the field a lot, so make sure that
                      your players are especially capable of doing so without tiring out.

              <article id="rules">
                <h3>Simple Rules</h3>

                      Aside from the rules of common sense, certain rules apply to the
                      game. Below is a list of basic rules you and your players should keep in
                      mind:
                      <br>
                      <ul>
                          <li>No shoving</li>
                          <li>No biting (Luis Suarez)</li>
                          <li>Do not intentionally bring a player down</li>
                          <li>Do not slide tackle from behind</li>
                          <li>Only the goalkeeper may use his hands</li>
                          <li>Keep both feet on the ground when doing a throw-in</li>
                          <li>Throw from behind your head with both hands for a throw-in</li>
                          <li>Only 11 players at a time per team</li>
                          <li>Depending on your league, your substitutions may be limited</li>
                      </ul>

              <article id="offside">
                <h3>What is Offside?</h3>

                      Offside is when a player is closer to the opponent's goal line than
                      the second-to-last opponent (last one being the goalkeeper).
                      <br><br>
                      For example:
                      <br>
                      <img src="./images/offside.png" alt="Offside" />
                      <br><br>
                      The blue player recieving the pass would be considered offside,
                      because he/she is behind the red team's line of defense. In soccer,
                      the pass reciever in considered in an illegal position of play. As a
                      result, the red team would be awarded a free kick.
